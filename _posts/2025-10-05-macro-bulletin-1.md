Welcome to the first issue of my Macro Bulletin. It seems the Fed and the RBI have worked extra hard to make this debut especially interesting. Let’s dive in.

### Global

1. Dallas Fed president Lorie Logan makes a case for moving away from the federal funds rate as the Fed’s operational target \[[FT](https://www.ft.com/content/a8aa0028-c05d-497d-9127-77bf009e8b71)]. She argues the connection between the federal funds rate and other money market rates has become increasingly ‘fragile’ over time and repo rates like Tri-party General Collateral Rate might be a more reliable anchor of short term liquidity conditions in the money market. You can read her speech [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2025/lkl250925).

2. Two senior Fed officials have recently made a case [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250926a.htm) and [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2025/lkl250825) to abandon the ample reserve system or ‘floor system’ in favor of a return to the ‘corridor system’ or the relatively newer ‘ceiling system’. For a deeper dive, see David Beckworth’s Substack post: [From Floors to Ceilings: The Fed’s Quiet Turning Point?](https://macroeconomicpolicynexus.substack.com/p/from-floors-to-ceilings-the-feds).

3. Is a French Sovereign-Debt crisis looming? \[[Desmond Lachman on Project Syndicate](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/france-sovereign-debt-crisis-will-cause-market-turmoil-before-ecb-intervention-by-desmond-lachman-2025-09)]

4. Argentina’s wily currency traders drain Javier Milei’s dollars \[[FT](https://www.ft.com/content/04259ad9-b53a-4575-bb06-852735b878ed)]. Also, check out [this one](https://www.ft.com/content/e5e314d0-31cf-44e0-9167-63a787baac47) to understand how Milei’s Argentina got here.

5. FT’s [Martin Sandbu](https://www.ft.com/martin-sandbu) puts the finger on the real problem with china’s overcapacity and large current account surplus \[[FT](https://www.ft.com/content/a2f3b927-d909-4eaa-9bac-c69675e41cd0https://www.ft.com/content/a2f3b927-d909-4eaa-9bac-c69675e41cd0)]. Unlike many other (myself not included), Martin is skeptical of Chinese overcapacity directly causing deindustrialization elsewhere. He argues the right question to ask is whether the resulting surplus can be absorbed productively in deficit countries—through investment inflows or consumption demand.

6. US manufacturing productivity growth might be higher than previously believed: A [new paper](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BFI_WP_2025-127.pdf) claims that manufacturing deflator might be understating the quality improvements in a few critical sectors. You can read the FT’s Alphaville’s piece on it here.

    Interestingly, another [paper on India](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0954349X23001352) also found that the ‘single deflation’ method used in India significantly understates manufacturing GDP. I’m starting to suspect many other counties could be underestimating manufacturing sector due to difficulties in measurement—especially the developing countries.

7. Stephen Miran, the latest-Trump appointed Fed governor, argued that the Fed should adopt a more forward looking framework that proactively anticipates changes to real rate R* and sets policy rate accordingly. You can read his speech [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20250922a.htm).

    The issue with this approach, however, is that it is extremely hard—if not impossible—to implement reliably. Another risk is that some policymakers may anticipate what they want rather than what the data is signalling. For a deeper dive, see FT’s Chris Giles’s post: [New thinking frameworks at the Federal Reserve](https://www.ft.com/content/807d060c-3090-4952-8fe6-bd389390e74e)—with one caveat: this is hardly “new thinking”—it is, in fact, one of the standard optimal monetary policy rule we study in graduate level macro courses.

8. US labour market indicator suggests little weakening in September [[FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8728c1b8-0923-4b1a-9f08-204717c8ada5)].

### India

 1. RBI on Wednesday announced 22 reforms across multiple fronts to loosen regulations on the banking sector and ease the flow of credit \[[BS](https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/rbi-unveils-22-measures-to-boost-credit-flow-ease-home-loan-burden-125100101519_1.html)]. A few highlights that stood out to me:

     1. RBI moves to internationalize the rupee \[[FT](https://www.ft.com/content/f2a242a9-3cc3-451c-8b53-589926991c2c)].

     2. The RBI just silently made some huge moves [[Zerotha’s Daily Brief](https://thedailybrief.zerodha.com/p/the-rbi-just-silently-made-some-huge)].

     3. RBI discontinues 14-day Variable Repo Rate (VRR) and Variable Reverse Repo Rate (VRRR) operations, which was reintroduced during the pandemic. This makes the 7-day VRR and VRRR the primary tool for RBI’s short term liquidity operations [[BS](https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/rbi-retains-call-rate-as-operating-target-under-revised-liquidity-framework-125093001147_1.html)].

 2. India to Cut Long-Tenor Bond Issuance on Waning Demand [[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-26/india-to-cut-long-tenor-bond-issuance-on-waning-demand)].

 3. Global investors are pulling back from Indian equities [Bloomberg]. Is it just a coincidence that China becomes ‘investable’ again at the same time? [[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-28/china-sheds-uninvestable-tag-as-2-7-trillion-gain-draws-inflows?sref=rvrmfDby)].
